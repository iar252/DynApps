This Jukebox is object oriented! The methods within the class can be accessed through either buttons that are clicked on the juxebox or the playSong() method will call them when necessary. 

How to use the Jukebox: 
You can start the default song by pressing the play button and you can pause the song by pressing the same button. 
If you do not like the current song playing, you can click the next button. 
If you wish to listen to a previously played song, you can click the previous button. 
You don't have to click through the songs to get to a desired one because you can click any of the songs from the list to play automatically (hover to see it is an option to choose desired song). 
You can also skip ahead in songs by changing the time on the slider. (One issue here is that sometimes it takes a second for the code to do the calculation and it actually displays the code). 
You can also adjust the volume on the jukebox! 
Extra feature: You have the option to shuffle the songs on your jukebox!
