# Daily Garden Bot

## About
The Daily Garden Bot tweets a garden every day. The plants create the background, and the flowers are arranged into the first letter of the day. There is also an animal in the corner of the garden. Underneath the garden, there is a sentence that tells the reader to have a [synonym of nice] day. 

This bot was created with Node.js. 

## How to Use 
The bot posts daily and uses the Date class to get the current day. In order to run the bot, the user has to enter the terminal, enter the same directory as the bot, and run "node app.js". If the computer is left on for several days, then the bot will print daily. For testing purposes, the day variable can be changed to tweet specific days. The variable takes an int.
