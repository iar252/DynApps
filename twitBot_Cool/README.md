Description: I used this assignment to tweet a garden (one plant and one type of animal) on an interval of 2 seconds. I used emojis to represent the plants and animals. This helped me better understand the code that we focused on in class on the 26th. I included comments on the thought process of the code (at the bottom of the app.js file).

Dependencies required to run it: The person running my code will need to install Twit which is a Twitter API Client for node 

The user can install this by typing in "npm install Twit" when they are in the desired directory
